Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Allow users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result. Enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI trend analysis through statistics and graphs.



Key Concepts and Challenges:

User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
GUI Design: Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.
User Experience: Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback.
